            </ul>

            <p>Lets begin with <strong>Step 1 &ndash;&nbsp;Making the dough</strong></p>
            <p>1. Take 1 cup all-purpose flour, &frac14; teaspoon salt and &frac12; teaspoon oil in a bowl. Mix well
                with a spoon. </p>
            <p>2.&nbsp;Add 2 to 3 tablespoon water in parts and begin to knead to a firm dough. Do not make the dough
                soft as then it becomes difficult to shape the dumplings.
                If required you can add 1.
            <p>3.&nbsp;Cover the dough with a moist napkin or kitchen towel. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes.</p>
            <p>4.&nbsp;Finely chop the vegetables. You will need 1.5 to 1.75 cups of finely chopped veggies.
                You can also use a food processor to finely chop vegetables like cabbage, carrots, etc.
            <p>Veggies like capsicum (green bell pepper), button mushrooms and spring onions (scallions) can be chopped
                with a knife. </p>
            <p>5. Heat oil in a thick bottomed frying pan or wok. Add &frac12; teaspoon finely chopped garlic.
                Saut&eacute;
                for 2 to 3 seconds on medium-low heat.</p>
            <p>6.&nbsp;Add spring onion whites (2 small spring-onions which have been chopped finely) . Stir and
                saut&eacute; for 10 to 15 seconds on medium-low heat. </p>
            <p>7.&nbsp;Add all the finely chopped vegetables.</p>
            <p>8.&nbsp;Increase the flame and stir fry the vegetables on a medium to high heat. If you have not used a
                thick bottomed pan, then saut&eacute; the veggies on a low to medium heat. Saut&eacute; or stir fry for
                2 to 3 minutes. Then add 1 teaspoon soy sauce, &frac12; teaspoon black pepper and salt as per taste.
            </p>
            <p>9.&nbsp;Continue to stir fry on a medium to high flame for 2 to 3 minutes more. Switch off the heat and
                add 1 to 2 tbsp of the spring onions greens. Mix well. Check the taste and add more salt, pepper or soy
                sauce, if needed.</p>
            <p>10. The vegetable stuffing is ready. Let the stuffing cool completely.</p>

            <p><strong><br>Step 2 &ndash; Shaping momos, 1st method</strong></p>



            <p>11.&nbsp;Divide the dough in two parts.</p>

            <p>12.&nbsp;Make a 7 to 8 inches log from each part.&nbsp;cut the log into equal slices.</p>
            <p>13.&nbsp;Shape into a ball of each dough piece and keep them covered with a moist napkin.</p>

            <p>14.&nbsp;Take each dough ball and on a lightly dusted board. Roll each dough ball into a thin circle of
                about 3 to 4 inches diameter.</p>



            <p>15. The edges have to be thin and the center has to be thick.</p>

            <p>16. Apply water with your finger tip or with a small pastry brush towards the circumference. This is an
                optional step.</p>
            <p>17.&nbsp;Place 2 to 3 teaspoons of vegetable stuffing in the center.</p>


            <p>18. Lift one side of the edge and start pleating. (You can also refer to the video above or in the recipe
                card below to see how the pleating is done).</p>

            <p>19. Begin to pleat the momos.</p>

            <p>20. Join all the pleats in the center.</p>

            <p>21. A pleated and shaped dim sum.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 2 &ndash; Shaping momos , 2nd method</strong></p>

            <p>22. Another simple technique to shape momos&nbsp;&ndash; join the edges</p>
            <p>23. This is an easy method. The momo&nbsp;is&nbsp;shaped like gujiya or karanji. You can stop here or can
                proceed to the next step.</p>


            <p>24. Bring both the end together and join.</p>


            <p>25. Prepare all momos this way and keep them covered under a moist napkin until you are ready to steam
                them.</p>


            <p><strong>Step 4 &ndash; Steaming veg momos</strong></p>

            <p>26. Grease a steamer pan with some oil.</p>

            <p>27. Arrange them in the pan, keeping space between them.</p>
            <p>28. Steam them in an electric cooker or a steamer pan. You can also use idli pan or pressure cooker to
                steam. Add 2 cups water in the pot or pan while steaming. (Check recipe notes in the recipe card below.)
            </p>
            <p>29. Cover and steam for 5 to 6 minutes till the outer dough becomes transparent. Don&rsquo;t overcook as
                then the outer dough, becomes dense and chewy. The steaming time may vary upon the thickness of
                momos&rsquo; cover.</p>

            <p>When you touch the momo then dough should not feel sticky to you. This means they are done and the momos
                will have a transparent look.</p>

            <p>30. Serve veg momos hot with momos chutney or red chilli-garlic chutney, spicy schezwan sauce or tomato
                sauce. They also go best with a spicy sauce and should be eaten hot.</p>
